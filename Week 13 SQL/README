The file player_stats.sql contains commands that when executed
creates three tables:

  + player_stats
  + player_bios
  + more_player_stats

These data give statistics about players active in the National Basketball
Association (NBA) 2015-16 season.    

The first two tables were derived from data made available
on NBA.com, specifically at http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/.

  + dreb_pct: defensive rebounding percentage
  + reb_pct: rebounding percentage
  + usg_psg: usage rate, see usg below
  + ts_pct: true-shooting percentage (see tspct)
  + ast_pct: assist rate, see astr below  
  + tspct: True Shooting Percentage - what a player's shooting percentage would be if we accounted for free throws and 3-pointers. True Shooting Percentage = Total points / [(FGA + (0.44 x FTA)]
  + astr: Assist Ratio - the percentage of a player's possessions that ends in an assist. Assist Ratio = (Assists x 100) divided by [(FGA + (FTA x 0.44) + Assists + Turnovers]
  + tovr: Turnover Ratio - the percentage of a player's possessions that end in a turnover. Turnover Ratio = (Turnover x 100) divided by [(FGA + (FTA x 0.44) + Assists + Turnovers]
  + usg: Usage Rate - the number of possessions a player uses per 40 minutes. Usage Rate = {[FGA + (FT Att. x 0.44) + (Ast x 0.33) + TO] x 40 x League Pace} divided by (Minutes x Team Pace)
  + orr: Offensive rebound rate
  + drr: Defensive rebound rate
  + rebr: Rebound Rate - the percentage of missed shots that a player rebounds. Rebound Rate = (100 x (Rebounds x Team Minutes)) divided by [Player Minutes x (Team Rebounds + Opponent Rebounds)]
  + per: Player Efficiency Rating is the overall rating of a player's per-minute statistical production. The league average is 15.00 every season.
  + va: Value Added - the estimated number of points a player adds to a team’s season total above what a 'replacement player' (for instance, the 12th man on the roster) would produce. Value Added = ([Minutes * (PER - PRL)] / 67). PRL (Position Replacement Level) = 11.5 for power forwards, 11.0 for point guards, 10.6 for centers, 10.5 for shooting guards and small forwards
  + ewa: Estimated Wins Added - Value Added divided by 30, giving the estimated number of wins a player adds to a team’s season total above what a 'replacement player' would produce.
